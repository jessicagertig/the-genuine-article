# The Genuine Article 


This project aims to provide a platform for displaying images and information about historical garments from the years 1800 to 1900. The focus of this application is on showcasing great images while also enabling users to easily access the authentic source location, such as museums or collections, where these garments are housed.

This application also serves as the administrative UI for the [The Genuine Article API](https://github.com/jessicagertig/the-genuine-article-api).

## Inspiration

The idea behind this project was born out of a combination of a deep background in history, an interest in primary sources, and frustration with the lack of context often found when searching for historical garment images online. By creating this application, we hope to bridge that gap by providing both stunning visuals and reliable sourcing details.

*This project is a work in progress.*

- Information Display: Get detailed information about each garment including its origin, materials used, and any relevant historical context.
- Authentic Source Linking: Easily navigate to the authentic source location (museums, collections) associated with each displayed garment.
- Filtering Options: Utilize various filters like time period or type of clothing to narrow down your search results and find specific garments of interest. (*coming soon*)
